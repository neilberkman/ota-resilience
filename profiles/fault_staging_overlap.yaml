description: >-
  Vulnerable OTA where the staging and active regions overlap. The copy
  overwrites both the source and destination simultaneously, so even a
  clean (non-faulted) copy can produce a corrupt image. With power-loss
  faults, the corruption is compounded. Uses the vulnerable copy-in-place
  firmware as the representative broken implementation.
