description: >-
  Vulnerable OTA that begins copying the staging image before validating it.
  If the staging image is corrupt or incomplete, the copy overwrites the
  active slot with garbage. Combined with power-loss, even a partially-
  received staging image gets copied, destroying the known-good active slot.
  Uses the vulnerable copy-in-place firmware which performs zero validation.
