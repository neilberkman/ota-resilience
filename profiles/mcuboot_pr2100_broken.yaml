# Primary trailer: magic=GOOD, copy_done=SET(0x01), image_ok=UNSET(0xFF).
# This triggers BOOT_SWAP_TYPE_REVERT in MCUboot's swap table.
# Primary slot ends at 0x82000, so trailer is at end of primary:
#   magic at 0x82000 - 16 = 0x81FF0
#   copy_done at 0x82000 - 16 - 16 = 0x81FE0 (BOOT_MAX_ALIGN=8)

  # If revert succeeded, we should see slot0's value.
