description: >-
  Vulnerable OTA that copies staging over the active slot with no CRC or
  integrity check before or after the copy. A partial write leaves the
  active image corrupted with no way to detect or recover from the damage.
  Uses the vulnerable copy-in-place firmware as the representative broken
  bootloader.
