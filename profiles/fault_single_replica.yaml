description: >-
  Vulnerable OTA with only a single metadata replica. Even if the bootloader
  uses A/B slots, a torn write to the sole metadata struct loses the record
  of which slot is active. Without a second replica with independent CRC,
  the bootloader cannot determine which slot to boot after a power-loss
  during metadata update. Uses the vulnerable firmware as stand-in.
